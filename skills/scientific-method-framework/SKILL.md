## Overview

A reusable framework that enhances investigation skills with systematic scientific methodology including hypothesis management, evidence evaluation, statistical validation, and controlled experimentation. Provides methodological rigor to software investigation while maintaining compatibility with existing `support-investigation` and `development-investigation` workflows.

📖 **Framework Reference**: [reference/framework-reference.md](reference/framework-reference.md)

## Core Workflow

### Essential Operations (Most Common - 90% of Usage)

**1. Initialize Scientific Investigation**
```bash
# Set up investigation with systematic tracking
init_scientific_investigation "ZYN-10585: Payment processing failures"
```

**2. Generate and Register Competing Hypotheses**
```bash
# Register minimum 3 hypotheses for scientific rigor
register_hypothesis "h1" "Database connection timeout" "high"
register_hypothesis "h2" "Payment gateway API changes" "medium"
register_hypothesis "h3" "Configuration drift" "low"
```

**3. Systematic Evidence Collection**
```bash
# Collect evidence with credibility scoring (1-10 scale)
collect_evidence "datadog" "Error rate spike at 14:30 UTC" "9/10"
collect_evidence "database" "Connection pool exhaustion metrics" "10/10"
collect_evidence "code" "Recent payment service changes" "7/10"
```

**4. Hypothesis Testing with Controls**
```bash
# Test each hypothesis in controlled environment
test_hypothesis "h1" --method="staging_reproduction" --control="baseline_traffic"
validate_in_staging --hypothesis="h1" --reproduction="confirmed"
```

**5. Statistical Validation and Conclusion**
```bash
# Validate findings with statistical confidence
validate_conclusion --confidence-interval=95 --bias-check=true
generate_recommendations --primary-hypothesis="h1" --confidence=85% --fallback="h2"
```

**6. Integration with Development Process**
```bash
# Generate hypothesis-driven test cases
scientific_findings | /backend-test-development --reproduce=true --hypothesis="h1"

# Plan controlled rollout with monitoring
experimental_design | /datadog-management --track-experiment=true --metrics="error_rate,response_time"
```

### Framework Integration Patterns

**As Standalone Framework:**
```bash
# Load scientific utilities and initialize investigation
source ~/.claude/skills/scientific-method-framework/scripts/core-functions.sh
init_scientific_investigation "ZYN-10585: Payment failures"
```

**Integration with Investigation Skills:**
```bash
# Enhanced support investigation
/support-investigation --scientific-mode=true --issue="ZYN-10585"

# Enhanced development investigation
/development-investigation --experimental=true --task="query optimization"

# Handoff to testing with scientific findings
generate_test_cases --hypothesis-driven=true --target="backend-test-development"
```

## Core Components

### 1. Hypothesis Management
- **Systematic Registration**: Track multiple competing hypotheses with priority scoring
- **Alternative Testing**: Ensure exploration of competing explanations
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor testing progress and validation status

### 2. Evidence Evaluation Framework
- **Source Credibility Scoring**: Database (10/10), Logs (9/10), Code (7/10), Anecdotal (3/10)
- **Multi-source Validation**: Require corroboration across evidence types
- **Bias Detection**: Systematic checks for confirmation bias

### 3. Statistical Validation
- **Confidence Intervals**: Quantify uncertainty in findings (minimum 95%)
- **Significance Testing**: Validate claims with statistical rigor
- **Effect Size Measurement**: Distinguish statistical from practical significance

### 4. Controlled Experimentation
- **Staging Validation**: Reproduce findings in controlled environments before production
- **Progressive Rollout**: Monitor implementation with automatic rollback
- **A/B Testing**: Compare solutions with statistical validation

### Evidence Credibility Scale
| Source Type | Score | Examples | Usage Guidelines |
|------------|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Database/System Metrics** | 10/10 | Query performance, error rates | Primary evidence for technical issues |
| **Monitoring Dashboards** | 9/10 | Datadog alerts, performance graphs | Strong supporting evidence |
| **Code Analysis** | 7/10 | Recent deployments, configuration changes | Good for correlation analysis |
| **User Reports** | 6/10 | Support tickets with timing data | Useful for impact validation |
| **Anecdotal Observations** | 3/10 | "It seems slower", team discussions | Requires validation with higher-credibility sources |

## Quick Reference

### Common Investigation Patterns
- **Production Issue Investigation**: 3+ hypotheses (infrastructure, code, external) → Multi-source evidence → Staging validation → 95% confidence
- **Performance Optimization**: Baseline measurement → Hypothesis-driven approaches → A/B testing → Progressive rollout
- **Architecture Analysis**: Alternative design hypotheses → Performance testing evidence → Controlled pilot → Data-driven decisions

### Scientific Investigation Checklist
**Before Starting:**
- [ ] Define investigation ID and scope
- [ ] Identify minimum 3 competing hypotheses
- [ ] Plan evidence collection strategy

**During Investigation:**
- [ ] Collect evidence from multiple independent sources
- [ ] Score credibility for each piece of evidence
- [ ] Test hypotheses in controlled environment (staging/QA)
- [ ] Document bias checks and alternative explanations tested

**Before Concluding:**
- [ ] Validate findings with statistical confidence (≥95%)
- [ ] Cross-check evidence for consistency
- [ ] Plan controlled rollout with monitoring
- [ ] Generate actionable recommendations with uncertainty quantified

## Preconditions

- Investigation skill framework (support-investigation or development-investigation) must be available
- Staging/QA environment access for hypothesis validation
- Statistical validation tools and controlled experiment capabilities
- Cross-functional team coordination for evidence validation
- Understanding of statistical confidence intervals and bias detection

## Refusal Conditions

The skill must refuse if:
- Investigation lacks minimum 3 competing hypotheses for scientific rigor
- Evidence collection relies solely on anecdotal sources without credibility scoring
- Hypothesis testing cannot be performed in controlled environment
- Statistical confidence requirements cannot be met (<95% for production decisions)
- Integration mode conflicts with available investigation skill frameworks
- Scientific methodology requirements conflict with time-critical incident response needs

When refusing, explain which scientific requirement prevents execution and provide specific steps to meet methodology standards, including hypothesis generation guidance, evidence collection improvements, controlled testing setup, or statistical validation procedures.
