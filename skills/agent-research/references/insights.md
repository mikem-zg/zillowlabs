## Agent Value Signals

**Buyer perspective:**
- Trustworthy first impression ranked #1
- Responsiveness closely follows
- Two-thirds of buyers contact multiple agents before hiring — first-touch clarity is critical

**Seller perspective:**
- Trustworthy and responsive are also top agent traits
- Most sellers use an agent over any other channel
- 63% contact only one agent; selection is often relationship-driven

## Tour Conversion Mechanics

**Critical stat:** Only ~40% of requested subsequent tours actually happen.

**Key findings:**
- Subsequent tours are ~3x more likely to fail when the agent is unresponsive
- When subsequent tours DO happen, buyers are 2-3x more likely to transact with that agent
- Buyers want clarity that they're working with the same buyer's agent (confusion with listing agents persists)

**Implication:** Agent responsiveness after initial contact is the single biggest lever for conversion. Reducing tour scheduling friction directly impacts closed deals.

## Messaging & Channels (ZIM vs SMS vs Email)

### ZIM (Zillow In-App Messaging)
- ~Half of all messages are scheduling-related
- Confirmations alone make up ~16.5% of agent messages
- Rich objects for tours and property sharing target the real work
- Agents send >2x as many messages as buyers
- Buyers often go in with properties already in mind

### Channel Preferences
| Channel | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **SMS** | Time-sensitive moments; feels more reliable for urgent communication |
| **ZIM (in-app)** | Keeps conversations organized and property-tied; especially valuable as stakeholders join in transaction phases |
| **Email** | Non-urgent notifications like saved-search alerts |

**Rule of thumb:** Use email for saved-search alerts; reserve ZIM/SMS for urgent or decision-critical updates.

## After-Hours Leads

- After-hours submitters prefer a text confirmation (or light text exchange) now, with next-day follow-up
- These leads skew high intent in propensity models
- Don't force calls late at night — offer helpful prompts (e.g., suggested times)
- Prioritize next-day agent outreach

## AI in Agent-Buyer Messaging

**User preference:** AI + Agent augmented models (agent oversight/edit, clear labeling)

**What works:**
- Instant answers covering basics
- Agents adding context and judgment
- A majority in testing chose the augmented model over pure-AI or pure-agent

**Requirements:**
- Agent edit/approve controls
- Clear labeling that AI was involved
- "AI-assisted, agent-verified" positioning
- Preserve agent judgment for nuanced situations

## Listing Media That Wins Business

### Floor Plans
- 81% of sellers say floor plans are "highly important"
- 86% of buyers more likely to view a home if listing includes a floor plan they like
- ~65% of sellers reported including a floor plan in 2024

### Virtual Tours
- 64% of sellers say virtual tours are "highly important"
- 71% of sellers more likely to hire an agent who includes interactive floor plans/virtual tours
- Dynamic floor plans help buyer decision-making

### Implication
Make floor plans table stakes. Add interactive tours for appropriate listings. Highlight these capabilities in listing presentations — they directly influence seller hiring decisions.

## Seller Workflow Digitization

**Current state:**
- 88% of sellers used at least one digital tool
- 92% would ideally use at least one

**Demand ranking:**
1. E-signing (strongest demand)
2. Centralized document management
3. Remote/mobile notary

**Implication:** Build a closing hub aligned with these top-3 demands. Sellers are ready for digital; agents who offer these tools have an advantage.

## Recommendations Summary

1. **Strengthen first-touch clarity** — Use "Tour this home" and "Message a buyer's agent" language; clearly state buyers are connected to a dedicated buyer's agent
2. **Make tours effortless** — Prioritize tour/property rich objects; instrument agent responsiveness nudges to lift the ~40% subsequent-tour completion gap
3. **Route messages right** — Email for alerts; ZIM/SMS for urgent; SMS for after-hours confirmations
4. **Win listings with media** — Floor plans as table stakes; interactive tours for differentiation
5. **Deploy AI as assist** — "AI-assisted, agent-verified" patterns; agent edit/approve controls
6. **Lean into after-hours intent** — Lightweight text confirmations; next-day agent outreach
7. **Prove impact with closing tools** — E-sign, centralized docs, remote/mobile notary
